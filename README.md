This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
How it works:

•	Upon opening the app, users see a calendar interface.

•	They can select a date by tapping on it, which highlights the selected date 

•	Users can enter an event name in the text input field and tap "Add Event" to add it to the selected date.

•	Added events can be viewed by clicking on view events button. Users can delete events by tapping the "Delete" button next to each event.

•	The app maintains the state of events even if the user navigates away from the current date.

Use of this application:

•	Work Planning: Professionals can use the app to manage work-related events, such as deadlines, meetings, or project milestones.

•	Academic Planning: Students can utilize the app to schedule their classes, exams, and study sessions.

•	Event Planning: Individuals or organizations planning events can use the app to keep track of important dates and tasks leading up to the event.

•	Reminder System: The app can serve as a reminder system, ensuring users don't forget important events or tasks by providing notifications or alerts.


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
